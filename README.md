Current Project – FurNest

FurNest is a pet adoption and rescue platform aimed at streamlining the process of connecting shelters, rescuers, and adopters. The application provides a compassionate digital ecosystem where users can:
->Discover and adopt verified pets through intuitive search and filters
->Connect with shelters and independent rescuers via in-app chat
->Share updates and stories post-adoption
->Receive community “Rescue Alerts” for urgent animal help nearby
->Utilize AI-driven pet matching, which analyzes user preferences, lifestyle, and environment to recommend the most compatible pets

Developed using React Native, Node.js, and Express.js, FurNest prioritizes accessibility, scalability, and real-time interaction, promoting ethical adoption and animal welfare.
